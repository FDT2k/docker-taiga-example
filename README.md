# Example Taiga Setup

This repo contains several example configurations for setting up Taiga using [docker-taiga](https://github.com/benhutchins/docker-taiga).

I recommend starting with the [simple](https://github.com/benhutchins/docker-taiga-example/tree/master/simple/) example which uses the latest stable taiga image from [benhutchins/taiga](https://hub.docker.com/r/benhutchins/taiga/).

For a more advanced example, which uses [taiga-events](https://hub.docker.com/r/benhutchins/taiga-events/) and configures a few additional plugins see the [advanced](https://github.com/benhutchins/docker-taiga-example/tree/master/advanced/) example.
